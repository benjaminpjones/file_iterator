# file_iterator
I am writing a project to analyze stock data which are stored in a csv format (as shown in ExampleData) (has semicolon delimiters)
I need to be able to move back and forth in the data file and return the data to be used in the functions (because they are originally only as strings). Since I couldn't find C++ functionality that can go back and forth in a file (like getline()), I written it myself.
